# Gas

This repo contains code for a practice CLI app that makes use of Clap and Ethers.

The CLI fetches the current block number and gas price from the RPC urls provided in the `.env` file.

## Usage

Add RPC urls to the `.env` file in the root of the project. The RPC urls should end in `RPC_URL`.

Running the CLI:

```bash
cargo run
```
